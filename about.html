    Hello! My name is Tammy and I'm in third year computer science major.<br /><br />
    This is an inventory management website, for CPSC 455 Assignment 1. <br /><br />
    To add an item of any kind, enter its name, description, price, and image URL. Very simple. <br /><br />
    Feel free to add and delete any item you want.<br /><br />
    Hope you enjoy!
